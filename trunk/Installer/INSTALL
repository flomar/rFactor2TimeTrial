rFactor2TimeTrial
=================

Follow these steps to get rFactor2TimeTrial up an running.

1. COPY FILES
=============

First, extract the rFactor2TimeTrial ZIP archive somewhere on your machine. 
It doesn't really matter where you put it, but you should remember the 
location.

Note that [rFactor2TimeTrial] refers to the root of the extracted archive, 
and [rF2] refers to the root of your rFactor2 installation.

Then, copy the following files:

   [rFactor2TimeTrial]/rF2TimeTrial/win32/rF2TimeTrial.dll ===> [rF2]/Bin32/Plugins
   [rFactor2TimeTrial]/rF2TimeTrial/win64/rF2TimeTrial.dll ===> [rF2]/Bin64/Plugins
   [rFactor2TimeTrial]/rf2TimeTrial/rF2TimeTrial.cfg ===> [rF2]


2. CONFIGURE CLIENT/SERVER SETTINGS
===================================

This step should be optional, as in: normally you don't need to do anything. 
However, if you experience weird behavior, or if the QTimeTrial HUD isn't 
showing up at all, make sure the settings in the ".bat" and ".cfg" files 
below match.

In both files, in [rFactor2TimeTrial]/QTimeTrial/QTimeTrial.bat as well as 
in [rF2]/rF2TimeTrial.cfg, you can set the parameters for the network 
connection. "127.0.0.1" and "9999" should work out of the box. If it 
doesn't, adapt both files accordingly.


3. CONFIGURE VISUALS
====================

For the user interface to work correctly, the resolution of your Windows 
desktop must be a multiple of FULL HD resolution (1920x1080), and rFactor2 
must be run in BORDERLESS mode (the video mode can be changed from within 
the rFactor2 launcher).

The following desktop resolutions are valid, but basically every resolution 
is supported as long as the aspect ratio is equal to FULL HD:

	960x540
	1280x720
	1600x900
	1920x1080
	3840x2160


4. START THE APPLICATION
========================

First, you need to start the QTimeTrial application. You can do this by 
double-clicking the [rFactor2TimeTrial]/QTimeTrial/QTimeTrial.bat file.

As soon as you can see the QTimeTrial menu bar on the left of your screen, 
you can proceed to start rFactor2 as usual. However, make sure you have 
configured the visuals as explained above.

Sometimes, and unfortunately I don't have found the source of the problem 
yet, the QTimeTrial user interface doesn't stay on top of the rFactor2 
user interface like it is intended to. In that case you have no other 
option but to exit rFactor2 and try again (QTimeTrial will be exited 
automatically if rFactor2 is).

Note that it seems to help if you keep clicking into the QTimeTrial menu 
bar while you can see the rFactor2 splash screen. It doesn't always help, 
but it does most of the time.


5. BEST PRACTICES
=================

Since QTimeTrial comes with its own HUD, I recommend to disable all 
graphical overlays of rFactor2. Furthermore, since nobody wants to be 
distracted during a time trial, disable the transparent trainer and 
untick all session settings (PRACTICE, QUALIFYING, and RACE) before 
starting a new session.

IMPORTANT: When you are in the box/garage, don't just hit the RACE button. 
Make sure you have selected a driver before doing so, otherwise nothing at 
all will be tracked, and you won't even see a HUD.

You can easily create drivers using the DRIVERS widget, and you can 
select the current driver by double-clicking. When you have selected a 
current driver, you are safe to hit the RACE button.

The rest should be more or less self-explanatory.
