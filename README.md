# rFactor2TimeTrial

rFactor2TimeTrial is a Qt-based extension for rFactor2 providing Gran-Turismo-like Time Trial functionality.

Basically the code in this repository is stable, but it lacks some functionality. Check out the TODO list for details.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me under florian(at)marchal(dot)de.
